# github-user-lookup

This was created for a Lunch & Learn presentation I gave at work in Oct 2016.

It includes the PowerPoint showing a brief overview of utilizing the Github API in JavaScript. The presentation also included a demo of [a simple web app](http://www.heatherlarsen.net/github-user-lookup) I built and a demo of [Gitlo](http://gitlo.co/)'s integration with the Github API.

The web app code is also included here. There are a couple of known bugs and a list of things I want to update, but it's now more of a fun project for me to work on from time to time.
